We added a testing program in proj3_test.go.

The test program will build a tree structure just like previous test. Then we vanish a piece of data ("Hello World") from one tree node, the key will be splitted to 20 pieces and stored in different tree-nodes. After that we un-vanish the data from the same tree node.

If the code worked properly, un-vanish will decrypted a data exactly like input ("Hello World").

Our program can work properly by encrypt and decrypt the input and get the same output.
